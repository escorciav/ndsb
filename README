This repo contains important files that I create for my participation on the
"National Science Bowl" competition of Kaggle.

ROADMAP
-------
1. Download data provided by kaggle in folder "data"

2. Create a virtual enviroment to interact with python without disturbing other
projects

3. Data statistics

4. Data Augmentation: just rotations, translations are considered on caffe
interface if receptive field is smaller than image resolution

3RD-PARTY SOFTWARE
------------------
numpy (1.9.1)
pandas (0.15.2)
scikit-image (0.10.1)
scikit-learn (0.15.2)
caffe: checkout my repo (tag: kaggle.nsb), if things are going wrong.

Probably more, you will discover it on demand ;)
